Hi, I’m Yonghao Liu. You can call me Eric.

I recently finished a data analytics bootcamp at University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies, focusing extensively on data analytics and data visualization skills.

I completed my Honours of Bachelor of Science at University of Toronto as well in June 2021.

I worked as contact centre representative before I get to Data Analytics.

Currently looking to pursue a data analyst career! I’m interested in any data ETL process, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.
