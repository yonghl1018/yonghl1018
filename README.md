üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me
-----------------
Hi, I‚Äôm Yonghao Liu. You can call me Eric.

I recently finished a data analytics bootcamp at University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies, focusing extensively on data analytics and data visualization skills.

I completed my Honours of Bachelor of Science at University of Toronto as well in June 2021. My major is Environmental Science and I also completed a minor program in Economics and another minor program in Psychology. 

I worked as an contact centre representative before I get to Data Analytics.

I am currently pursuing a data analyst career (ETL process, data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning)!
